#### Briefy About Myself: ####


After graduating from the Belarusian State University of Transport in 2018, I worked as an electrical engineer for three years on the Belarusian Railway.


As a result of this experience, I realized that I wanted to change the sphere of my activity and went to courses of frontend-developer. The skills I received there, such as js, html, css, working with Photoshop, were not enough to find a job, so I continued self-education, changing my job to the sphere of technical writing in IT.


Now I'm still continuing my education, not giving up hope to get a job as a frontend developer.

    for(let span of spans){
        span.addEventListener('click', function(){
            span.parentElement.remove();
            event.stopPropagation(); //перехват события
        })
    }
    for(let task of tasks){
        task.addEventListener('click', function(){
            task.style.textDecoration = "line-through";
            event.stopPropagation();
        })
    }
}
