    <h4>Briefy About Myself:</h4>
    <p>After graduating from the Belarusian State University of Transport in 2018, I worked as an electrical engineer for three years on the Belarusian Railway.</p>
    <p>As a result of this experience, I realized that I wanted to change the sphere of my activity and went to courses of frontend-developer. The skills I received there, such as js, html, css, working with Photoshop, were not enough to find a job, so I continued self-education, changing my job to the sphere of technical writing in IT.</p>
    <p>Now I'm still continuing my education, not giving up hope to get a job as a frontend developer.</p>
